# Overview
This work is a comprehensive solution designed to detect and provide real-time information about earthquake events. By utilizing seismic sensors and advanced machine learning and deep learning algorithms, the system aims to enhance preparedness and response efforts in earthquake-prone regions]. The code provided here implements the methodologies and experiments described in the paper, allowing for reproducibility and further exploration.

# Key objective
- [Objective 1]: Ensure timely and accurate notifications to users, enabling them to take appropriate actions and ensure their safety. 
- [Objective 2]: Leveraging the power of technology and data analysis, the system contributes to the overall goal of minimizing the impact of earthquakes on affected areas.
- [Objective 3]: Real-time detection and promoting community resilience.
